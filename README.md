<h1 align="center">Covid19 Data Exploration</h1>

<p>The regularly updated Covid-19 dataset is accessible on a number of websites, I download it from this one at https://bit.ly/3LmfAAG. In the dataset used for this investigation, cases from 24 February 2020 to 8 September 2022 were documented.I utilised MSSQL to examine this.The dataset contains information on cases, deaths, and vaccine columns.</p>
<h3 align="left">Questions I had:</h3>
- 	What is the impact of COVID19 globally?
- How many people in a nation contracted the disease?
- Which nations have the highest mortality rate per population?
- What are your odds of dying if you contract the disease by your country?
- What are your chances of contracting the disease if you live in India?
- What are your odds of dying in India if you contract the disease?
- Which continent have the highest mortality rate per population?
- How many people have received at least one Covid vaccine?
